i3
==

my i3 WM configuration (build on crunchbang).

A correct functioning desktop relies on the following apps:

1. The j4-dmenu-desktop dmenu replacement
[![Travis Build](https://api.travis-ci.org/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop.png)](https://travis-ci.org/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop/)
 (make and install this).
2. Some shell scripts for autolocking and gaussian blur in /shell
